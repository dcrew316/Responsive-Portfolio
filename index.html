    <img src="images/me.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Daniel Crew">

    <p>Hi,my name is Daniel Crew. I was born on July 3rd 1992 in Fayeteville, North Carolina. I only lived
            there for a year and then moved to Anchorage, Alaska where I spent most of my childhood. At the start of
            high school I moved to Colorado and is where I reside to this current day.</p>

    <p>My hobbies are snowboarding, riding my motorcycle, and playing videogames. Favorite place to snowboard
            is at Keystone. I ride a 2008 Kawasaki ZX6R, also known as a ninja. The video game I currently spend
            most of my time playing is Fortnite.</p>

    <p>Currently I am a fulltime Lyft driver. I do enjoy driving for Lyft since I enjoy meeting new people and
            talking to get to know them. All my time driving Lyft I have failed to meet people who are the same
            which is exciting. Also I am a student at University of Denver and taking a bootcamp for coding. So far
            it is very exciting since I am attending the school and class to start a new career.</p>
